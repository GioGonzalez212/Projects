# Projects

The **Projects** repository contains projects I have created and/or collaborated with team members during my time in university for future reference. All projects were created to be demonstrated for credit in previously enrolled courses. Thus, most specifications were requested by an instructor.

The US Navy project website page cannot be accessed as of this moment due to the AWS server being toggled off by order of the sponsor. Therefore, I provided the repository which contains all relevant files. The **project documentation** can be found by scrolling up above this readme that you are currently reading in docx format. Click on the file, then download on the right hand-side.
